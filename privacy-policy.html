            access
            to certain information about you.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and login using your third party social media account
            details
            (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
            information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending
            on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list,
            profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or

          <br><b>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b>

          <br>

          <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
            other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for
            longer than 1 year past the start of idle period of the user’s account.</p>
          <br>

          <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
            delete
            or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
            in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
            processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <br>

          <br><b>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</b>

            security measures.</p>
          <br>

          <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
            security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that
            the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
            transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access

          <br><b>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
            DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
            mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
            version of this privacy policy.

            the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately
            preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please

            “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
            changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or
